This is an Odin mini-project. The goal is to recreate the [Google](https://www.google.com) homepage. It is not meant to be a functional website, but is meant to visually mimic the original website. 

I hope to practice the following skills while building this:

- CSS
- Creating Forms
- Version Control
- Practice creating a README on Github (<-- This is now complete)

This project is from the Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css).
